# YouTube Video Chat with OpenAI API

This Streamlit app allows users to interact with YouTube videos using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. By extracting the transcript of a YouTube video, the app enables users to ask questions and receive answers based on the video's content.

---

## Features

- **Interact with YouTube Videos**: Ask questions about any YouTube video and receive detailed answers.
- **Transcripts from YouTube**: Automatically fetches transcripts from YouTube videos.
- **Customizable OpenAI GPT-4 Integration**: Allows users to connect their own OpenAI API key to use GPT-4 for generating answers.
- **Embedding Knowledge Base**: Uses EmbedChain and Chroma to store and query video transcripts.

---

## Requirements

Before running the app, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit: Web framework to build the app
- OpenAI: GPT API for generating responses
- EmbedChain: A framework to embed text and chat with the model
- YouTube Transcript API: Extract transcripts from YouTube videos
- Chroma: Vector database for storing video embeddings

---

### 3. Interact with YouTube Videos

1. **Enter your OpenAI API key** in the provided input field.
2. **Enter a YouTube video URL** in the second input field.
   - The app supports both regular YouTube videos and YouTube Shorts URLs.
3. **Chat with the video**: After the transcript is fetched, you can ask any question about the video, and the model will provide an answer based on the transcript.

## Code Overview

### `chat_youtube.py`

- **Imports**: Imports necessary libraries such as `streamlit`, `embedchain`, `openai`, and `youtube_transcript_api`.
- **embedchain_bot(db_path: str, api_key: str)**: Initializes and returns an instance of EmbedChain with a specific configuration.
- **extract_video_id(video_url: str)**: Extracts the video ID from a provided YouTube URL (works with both normal videos and Shorts).
- **fetch_video_data(video_url: str)**: Fetches the transcript for the provided YouTube video and returns it as text.
- **Streamlit UI**: Provides inputs for OpenAI API key and YouTube video URL, handles displaying the responses, and manages errors.
- **Temporary Database**: Creates a temporary directory for storing the video transcript using the `tempfile.mkdtemp()` method.

### Libraries

- **Streamlit**: Used to create the interactive web interface for the app.
- **EmbedChain**: Manages embeddings and stores the video transcripts for querying.
- **YouTube Transcript API**: Extracts text from video transcripts, which is used as the knowledge base for the app.
- **Chroma**: Stores embeddings to allow for querying against the stored video transcript.

### Streamlit UI:

- Title and description at the top, explaining the app's functionality.
- An input field for the OpenAI API key to connect the app with OpenAI services.
- If the API key is provided, it initializes the Embedchain app and sets up the temporary vector database.
- A text input for the YouTube video URL, where the app will fetch the videoâ€™s transcript and store it in the knowledge base.
- Once the video is added, the user can type in any question related to the video, and the app will use OpenAI to generate a response.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issue**: If the OpenAI API key is invalid or missing, the app will not work. Make sure the API key is correct and active.
- **No Transcript Available**: If a video doesn't have an available transcript, the app will display a warning and will not allow the user to ask questions about the video.
- **Video URL**: Ensure the URL provided is a valid YouTube link (either regular or Shorts). Invalid URLs will raise an error.

---

## Potential Improvements

- **Fetch Video Title**: The app currently uses "Unknown" as the title for all videos. We can enhance it to fetch the actual title from YouTube using the YouTube Data API.
- **Persistent Storage**: Currently, the vector database is stored temporarily. You may want to implement a more persistent solution for saving data across sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Additional error handling can be added to ensure smoother user experiences.
